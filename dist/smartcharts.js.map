If `allowReplaceOHL` is not set, the 'Open' is preserved from the existing candle; new 'High' and 'Low' values are calculated, and the 'Close' and 'Volume' values are replaced with the new ones.\n\t * - Although gaps can be present, dates in the appendQuotes array **must maintain the correct periodicity and order** (older to newer) to prevent out of sequence bars.\n\t * - If set, gaps will be filled past the currently existing bar. No gaps will be filled when inserting bars in between existing data.\n\t *\n\t * **The following rules apply when streaming individual `LAST SALE` data, tick by tick, as they are received from a streaming feed:**\n\t *\n\t * - Follow proper LAST SALE format as outlined on the parameters section under the `appendQuotes` field.\n\t * - This method is designed to update the chart while maintaining the existing periodicity, finding and augmenting an existing bar for an instrument or creating new bars as needed.\n\t * - It is important to note that a market iterator will be used to find the proper bar to update, and if no bar is found on that date, one will be created even in the past; so always be sure your historical data follows the rules of the market definitions when setting the dates for each bar. Remember that by default, weeks start on Sunday unless a market definition exists to indicate Sunday is not a market day, in which case the next market day will be used as the beginning of the week. Instructions to set a market for the chart can be found here: {@link CIQ.Market}\n\t * - When in 'tick' interval, each trade will be added to a new bar and no aggregation to previous bars will be done.\n\t *\n\t * **The following rules apply when updating `BID` and `ASK` prices separately from the primary series.**\n\t *\n\t * - Bid, Ask and Volume are reserved for the primary series only.\n\t * - The reasoning is that if your initial data sends a Bid-Ask together with the 'Close' (Last), your updates will as well; which is usually the norm.\n\t * - But if your feed sends updates for Bid and Asks separately than for the 'Last' price, then you must add this additional data as you would do any other secondary series.\n\t *\n\t * > Assuming you have this data pre-loaded on your chart already containing Bid and Ask prices:\n\t * > ```\n\t * > [\n\t * > \t{\n\t * > \t\t\"DT\": \"2019-11-19T18:17:29.000Z\",\n\t * > \t\t\"Close\": 266.12,\n\t * >\t\t\"Volume\": 300,\n\t * > \t\t\"Bid\": 266.1,\n\t * > \t\t\"Ask\": 266.12,\n\t * >\t},\n\t * >\t{\n\t * >\t\t\"DT\": \"2019-11-19T18:17:29.000Z\",\n\t * > \t\t\"Close\": 266.12,\n\t * > \t\t\"Volume\": 300,\n\t * > \t\t\"Bid\": 266.1,\n\t * > \t\t\"Ask\": 266.12,\n\t * >\t}\n\t * > ]\n\t * > ```\n\t * > And have added this series to display the pre-loaded Bid prices:\n\t * > ```\n\t * > stxx.addSeries(\"Bid\", {color: \"green\", loadData: false, shareYAxis: true, step:true});\n\t * > ```\n\t * > Use:\n\t * > ```\n\t * > stxx.updateChartData({Close:90}, null, { useAsLastSale: true, secondarySeries: \"Bid\" });\n\t * > ```\n\t * > or\n\t * > ```\n\t * > stxx.updateChartData({Last:90}, null, {secondarySeries: \"Bid\" });\n\t * > ```\n\t * > to update the bid prices.\n\t *\n\t * **Performance:**\n\t *\n\t * - To maintain system performance you can throttle inbound ticks. See {@link CIQ.ChartEngine#streamParameters } and [Streaming tutorial]{@tutorial DataIntegrationStreaming} for more details.\n\t * - It is important to note that although the data will always be added to masterData, `createDataSet()` and `draw()` will **not** be called if data is received quicker than the throttle (governor) wait periods. As such, you will not see any changes until the throttle wait periods are met.\n\t * - **Please adjust default settings if your implementation requires immediate updates.**\n\t *\n\t * **Additional Notes:**\n\t *\n\t * - **It is crucial that you ensure the date/time of the records being loaded are in line with your `masterData` and `dataZone`; and in the case of a last trade streaming, that your market definition will produce dates that will be in sync with the rest of your already loaded records.** See `DT` parameter for more details.\n\t * - This method is **not** intended to be used as a way to load initial chart data, or data changes triggered by periodicity changes.\n\t * - Do not stream current updates into the chart using this method if you have used [setSpan]{@link CIQ.ChartEngine#setSpan} or [setRange]{@link CIQ.ChartEngine#setRange} to enter 'historical mode'.\n\t * When in historical mode, forward pagination is based on the date of the last loaded bar, and streaming current updates will create a data gap.\n\t * To check if you are in historical mode evaluate {@link CIQ.ChartEngine#isHistoricalModeSet}\n\t *\n\t * See the [Data Integration]{@tutorial DataIntegrationOverview} tutorial for more detail on how to load initial data.\n\t *\n\t * See the [Streaming]{@tutorial DataIntegrationStreaming} tutorial for more the details.\n\t *\n\t * @param  {array|object} appendQuotes\t\t**OHLC format requirements**<br><br>\n\t * \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAn **array** of properly formatted OHLC quote object(s).

Specifically the 'Close' and 'Volume' fields will be streamed.\n\t * @param {boolean} [params.useAsLastSale.aggregatedVolume] If your last sale updates send current volume for the bar instead of just the trade volume, set this parameter to 'true' in the `params.useAsLastSale` object.

See {@link CIQ.ChartEngine#dataCallback}. If neither one is set and new data is needed, the function will fail.\n\t *\n\t * This function can be called together with `loadChart()` by setting the proper parameter values. See example in this section and {@link CIQ.ChartEngine#loadChart} for more details and compatibility with your current version.\n\t *\n\t * This function will not set how much data you want the chart to show on the screen; for that you can use {@link CIQ.ChartEngine#setRange} or {@link CIQ.ChartEngine#setSpan}.\n\t *\n\t * The kernel is capable of deriving weekly and monthly charts by rolling-up daily data. Set {@link CIQ.ChartEngine#dontRoll} to true to bypass this\n\t * functionality if you have raw week and month data in the masterData.\n\t *\n\t * It is important to note that by default the weekly roll-ups start on Sunday unless a market definition exists to indicate Sunday is not a market day,\n\t * then they are shifted to the next market day. Instructions to set a market for the chart can be found here: {@link CIQ.Market}\n\t *\n\t * A full tutorial on periodicity and roll-up can be found [here]{@tutorial Periodicity}.\n\t *\n\t * **See {@link CIQ.ChartEngine#createDataSet} for additional details on the roll-up process including important notes on rolling-up data with gaps.**\n\t *\n\t * **Note on 'tick' timeUnit:**<BR>\n\t * When using 'tick', please note that this is not a time based display, as such, there is no way to predict what the time for the next tick will be.\n\t * It can come a second later, a minute later or even more depending on how active a particular instrument may be.\n\t * If using the future tick functionality ( {@link CIQ.ChartEngine.XAxis#futureTicks} ) when in 'tick' mode, the library uses a pre-defined number (  {@link CIQ.ChartEngine.XAxis#futureTicksInterval} )for deciding what time interval to use for future ticks.\n\t * See below example on how to override this default.\n\t *\n\t * It is important to note that rollups for ‘ticks’ are based on **count** rather than time.\n\t * <br>For example: `setPeriodicity({period:5, interval:1, timeUnit:\"tick”})` will create a new bar every **5 ticks** rather than every **5 minutes**.\n\t *\n\t * Since many ticks can have the exact same timestamp, ticks never get replaced or augmented. As such, if a new tick is provided with a timestamp in the past, even if a record with the exact same date already exists, a new tick will be inserted to the masterData at the proper location rather than one replaced.\n\t *\n\t * Lastly, you cannot set an interval for `tick`; as that would not translate into a valid periodicity. If inadvertently set, the engine will \"clean it up\" (much the same way as if you tried `{period:1, interval:5, timeUnit:\"day\"}` ).\n\t *\n\t * **Note on internal periodicity storage:**<BR>\n\t * The provided parameters will be translated into internal format and stored in the {@link CIQ.ChartEngine#layout} object.\n\t * Internal format in the layout object **will not match the parameters** used in ​setPeriodicity.\n\t * <br>Use {@link CIQ.ChartEngine#getPeriodicity} to extract internal periodicity into the expected external format.\n\t *\n\t * @example\n\t * // each bar on the screen will represent 15 minutes (combining 15 1-minute bars from your server)\n\t * stxx.setPeriodicity({period:15, timeUnit:\"minute\"}, function(err){});\n\t *\n\t * @example\n\t * // each bar on the screen will represent 15 minutes (a single 15 minute bar from your server)\n\t * stxx.setPeriodicity({period:1, timeUnit:\"minute\", interval:15}, function(err){});\n\t *\n\t * @example\n\t * // each bar on the screen will represent 30 minutes formed by combining two 15-minute bars; each masterData element represening 15 minutes.\n\t * stxx.setPeriodicity({period:2, timeUnit:\"minute\", interval:15}, function(err){});\n\t *\n\t * @example\n\t * // each bar on the screen will represent 1 tick and no particular grouping will be done.\n\t * stxx.setPeriodicity({period:1, timeUnit:\"tick\"}, function(err){});\n\t *\n\t * @example\n\t * // each bar on the screen will represent 5 ticks (combining 5 tick objects from your server)\n\t * stxx.setPeriodicity({period:5, timeUnit:\"tick\"}, function(err){});\n\t *\n\t * @example\n\t * // each bar on the screen will represent 1 day.

Some feeds provide data that is already rolled up. For example, there may be a feed that provides 5 minute bars. To let the chart know you want that 5-minute bar from your feed instead of having the chart get individual 1 minute bars and roll them up, you would set the `interval` to '5' and `timeUnit` to 'minute'\n\t * @param {string} [params.timeUnit] Type of data requested.

The current price pulsates\n * 2.  The current price appears to move smoothly from the previous price\n * 3.  The chart's y-axis smoothly expands/contracts when a new high or low is reached\n *\n * The following chart types are supported: line, mountain, baseline_delta.\n *\n * Chart aggregations such as Kagi, Renko, Range Bars, etc. are not supported.\n *\n * **Animation displays more gracefully when updates are sent into the chart one at a time using {@link CIQ.ChartEngine#updateChartData}\n * instead of in batches using a [QuoteFeed]{@link CIQ.ChartEngine#attachQuoteFeed}. Sending data in batches will produce a ‘jumping’ effect.**\n *\n * By default there will be a flashing beacon created using a canvas circles. If instead you want to use a custom animation beacon, you will be able to extend the functionality yourself as follows:\n * - In js/addOns.js, at the bottom of the CIQ.Animation function, there is an stx.append(\"draw\") function.\n * - Make a copy of this function so you can override the behavior.\n * - In there you will see it determine var x and y, which are the coordinates for the center of the beacon.\n * - At the bottom of this append function, where we draw the beacon by using the Canvas arc() function to draw a circle and then fill() to make the circle solid.\n * - You can replace this circle and fill instructions with an image using [CanvasRenderingContext2D.drawImage()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D#Drawing_images) .\n *\n * Animation Example <iframe width=\"800\" height=\"500\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"seamless\" align=\"top\" style=\"float:top\" src=\"https://jsfiddle.net/chartiq/6fqw652z/embedded/result,js,html/\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"1\"></iframe>\n *\n * @param {CIQ.ChartEngine} stx The chart object\n * @param {object} animationParameters Configuration parameters\n * @param {boolean} [animationParameters.stayPut=false] Set to true for last tick to stay in position it was scrolled and have rest of the chart move backwards as new ticks are added instead of having new ticks advance forward and leave the rest of the chart in place.\n * @param {number} [animationParameters.ticksFromEdgeOfScreen=5] Number of ticks from the right edge the chart should stop moving forward so the last tick never goes off screen (only applicable if stayPut=false)\n * @param {number} [animationParameters.granularity=1000000] Set to a value that will give enough granularity for the animation.  The larger the number the smaller the price jump between frames, which is good for charts that need a very slow smooth animation either because the price jumps between ticks are very small, or because the animation was set up to run over a large number of frames when instantiating the CIQ.EaseMachine.\n * @param {number} [animationParameters.tension=null] Splining tension for smooth curves around data points (range 0-1).  Must include splines.js for this to be effective.\n * @param {CIQ.EaseMachine} easeMachine Override the default easeMachine.  Default is `new CIQ.EaseMachine(Math.easeOutCubic, 1000);`\n * @constructor\n * @name  CIQ.Animation\n * @since\n * <br>&bull; 3.0.0 Now part of addOns.js.
