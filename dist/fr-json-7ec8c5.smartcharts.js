Based on the Alligator indicator, the Gator plots 2 histograms on either side of the zero line. The sleeping phase (absence of a trend) is when the bars on both sides are red. The awakening phase (formation of a trend) is when there are red and green bars on both sides. When there are green bars on both sides, it indicates the eating phase (trend strengthening). A solitary red bar appearing after the eating phase indicates the beginning of the sated phase (trend approaching its end).":"The Gator Oscillator helps to detect trend changes in the market price.

When the lines intersect, it’s an indicator of price reversal and the angle of the lines are helpful to predict the trend strength. The steeper the curve, the stronger the trend. When the price crosses the moving average lines from below, it signals an upward trend. When the price crosses the moving average lines from above, it signals a downward trend. The RMA is easier to use compared to using several different moving average indicators at once.":"The Rainbow Moving Average (RMA) displays several moving average lines simultaneously.

It calculates the distance between the current closing price and the median of the high/low range, and displays 2 lines on the chart: the first (known as %K) represents the price movement while the second (known as %D) is a moving average of the first line. If the closing price is higher than the median of the high/low range, the SMI returns a positive value. If the closing price is lower than the average price, a negative value is returned. Values above 40 indicate a bullish trend while values below -40 indicate a bearish trend.":"The Stochastic Momentum Index (SMI) helps to identify overbought or oversold conditions in the market and to predict bearish or bullish trends.
